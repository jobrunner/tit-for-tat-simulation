# tit-for-tat-simulation

This is an very simple agent based simulation written in go that should show the "benefits" (expressed in reached points) of the behaviors: always cooperate, always defect or [tit-for-tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat). 

The Simulation runs in a 640x480 pixel simulation window and is ugly. It was a little fun project for mysqlf while learning simulations in go.
