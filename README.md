# tit-for-tat-simulation

This is a agent-based simulation written in Go that aims to demonstrate the "benefits" (measured in points reached) of the following behaviors: always cooperating, always defecting, or [tit-for-tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat).

The simulation runs in a 640x480 pixel window and looks quite basic. It was a small fun project I created for myself while learning simulations in Go.
